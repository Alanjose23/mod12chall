# Department Resource CMS

## Description
This is a department tracker and role changer for a particular buisness that has the requirements to add departments,roles, and names to a buisness. It does this by using database and running the server to create and add prompts to make changes in the server. I built this for companies who want to see and change their company departments, roles, and employees. The biggest thing I learned from this experience was to always use console log to check my results and create the proper control flow for my assignment.
